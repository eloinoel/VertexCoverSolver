You can find three executable programs for each implemented bound: Clique Bound -> VertexCoverSolverClique, Cycle Bound -> VertexCoverSolverCycle and LP Bound -> VertexCoverSolverLP. The VertexCoverSolver implements the Neighbourhood Branching algorithm from the second lecture. The executables should work with the benchmark script. We also tested them on the VM. If for some reason the program does not run, we have provided the source code in the /src folder with instructions how to compile and run it in a README.md.

The overall best performing implementations are Clique or LP Bound. While the Clique Bound gives better estimates for the vertex cover size, it also takes significantly longer to calculate. Overall, the LP Bound implementation gives way better performance for the 1-random tests, because it is so much faster to calculate. However, we observed that a more tight bound pays off for the social-network tests, where the Clique Bound implementation performed better.
